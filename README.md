## Far Right Analysis

**Slack:** [#far-right](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/far-right)

**Project Leads:** @nick, @sjackson, @jonathon

**Maintainers (people with write/commit access):**
* GitHub: @jonathon, @nick, @sjackson
* data.world: @jonathon

**Data:** Head over to [data.world](https://data.world/data4democracy/far-right) to check out our most up-to-date data! That's a private dataset, so ask @jonathon if you need access. It contains datasets specific to militia groups operating on Facebook, and white supremecists on Twitter, which might help you get started. Also, the [#assemble](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/assemble) channel in Slack (and the related [assemble GitHub repo](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/assemble)) is dedicated to collecting data for analysis, and may be able to help you build a dataset you need.

**Project Description:** This repo is for collecting analyses related to the behavior of extreme far right online communities. It's likely that this will be temporary until we move to a platform that's designed more specifically for collaborative research, but it'll do in the meantime. Research/analysis ideas are collected [as issues](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/far-right-analysis/issues) - please don't hesitate to add your ideas, or take ownership of an analysis project that's interesting to you. 

There are several related veins of work going on in the group at the current time:
* **Data Collection, Cleaning, and Joining**  
* **Data Visualization**
* **Modelling**
* **Analysis** 

## Getting Started

### Want to Contribute?
* **"First-timers" are welcome!** Whether you're trying to learn data science, hone your coding skills, or get started collaborating over the web, we're happy to help. If you have any questions feel free to pose them on our [slack channel](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/far-right), or reach out to one of the team leads. That channel is a good place to go with preliminary ideas, before you're ready to add them as issues here. If you have questions about Git and GitHub specifically, our [github-playground](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground) repo and the [#github-help](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/github-help) Slack channel are good places to start.
* **Feeling Comfortable with GitHub, and Ready to Dig In?** Check out our GitHub issues. This is our official listing of the work that we are planning to get done. As we add more issues, the maintainers will make sure to specifically tag those issues that are good for beginners with: `beginner-friendly`
* **This README is a Living Document:** If you see something you think should be changed feel free to edit and submit a Pull Request. Not only will this be a huge help to the group, it is also a great first PR!
* **Got an Idea for Something We Should be Working On?** You can submit an issue on our GitHub page, mention your idea on the [slack channel](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/far-right), or reach out to one of the project leads.
